Appellancy API & Sample

Using the API is incredibly easy. Just include the header, load Appellancy.dylib, initialize a face recognizer, and tada.
You’ll need to create a delegate class object for Appellancy.

Any problems or questions, don’t hesitate to ask!

Code under WTFPL. No guarantees the sample actually works, although i have tested it.
