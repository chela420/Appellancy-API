Appellancy API & Sample

Using the API is incredibly easy. Just include the header, load Appellancy.dylib, initialize a face recognizer, and tada.
You’ll need to create a delegate class object for Appellancy.

Any problems or questions, don’t hesitate to ask!

As of 0.0.1-160, you can listen for accepted Notifications using CFNotificationCenter. this only makes sense if you are running a lock screen tweak of some sort.

The events are:
#define AFaceAccepted "com.efrederickson.appellancy.face_accepted"
#define AFaceRejected "com.efrederickson.appellancy.face_rejected"

And to listen, use:
CFNotificationCenterRef r = CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter();
    CFNotificationCenterAddObserver(r, NULL, &face_accepted_notification, CFSTR("com.efrederickson.appellancy.face_accepted"), NULL, 0);
And, of course, define the face_accepted_notification or whatever you need to do.


Code under WTFPL. No guarantees the sample actually works, although i have tested it.
